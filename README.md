# React Mini Projects

This repository is a collection of small React-based projects created as part of my learning and exploration of modern frontend development.  
Each project focuses on a different concept, UI pattern, or React feature such as state management, hooks, reusable components, and interactive UI behavior.

The goal of this repository is to practice, experiment, and improve my React skills with hands-on mini projects.

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

- A growing list of independent mini React projects  
- Each project has its own folder inside the `/React-Mini-Projects` directory  
- All projects are built with **React** and **Vite**  
- No dependency on each other – every project runs independently
